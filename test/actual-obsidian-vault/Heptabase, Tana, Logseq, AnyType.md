## Heptabase
### Tags
* How do I sort a tag database in table view?
* After applying a tag with <cmd-t, select tag, esc>. How do I focus the tag attribute without using the mouse?

### Cards
* I don’t see the point of the card view. It would be more useful if cards were presented in a list. Is this possible via some setting?
* When I drag a PDF into a card, the PDF itself becomes a separate card. Why is this? I want the PDF to be associated with the card I dropped it in. Now I end up with a bunch an “uncategorized” card for each of the PDF files.
* If I follow a link to a PDF in a card, the PDF is opened on top of the card. How do I close the PDF and get back to the card? Esc closes both the PDF and the card.

### PDFs
* I have some already annotated PDFs. Can I convert those annotations to Heptabase annotations? Also, why doesn’t heptabase already recognize standardized PDF annotations? 

### Date links
* It’s cool that I can add date links and they show up in the journal, but..
  * It would be great if those could be visualized as a timeline. I.e. a timeline view with filters like the card view
* How do I change the date format to ISO (yyyy-mm-dd)?

### Exporting files
Exporting files, eg. a pdf receipt, gets you a zip file. Clumsy solution.

## Tana
Interesting tool.
No long writeup support
Still in beta

## Logseq
Local first
OSS
A bit immature, buggy with keyboard shortcuts, focus, etc

## AnyType
Notion copy byt with local data.
Very flexible theoretically, but design is too “Notion:esk” and feels locked up, almost dated.
