# Settings for controlpointTypes in projects
#plantrail/controlpointTypes
#plantrail/projects

## Background
Projects can have settings for different controlpoint types. Which controlpoint types can be created in a project is dictated by:
- is a controlpoint-setting explicitly added to the project (i.e. automatic adding will be inhibited)
- the roles granted to the user
