## D6000
The larger motor is definitely German. I don't know where the standard motor comes from, but it has a poor design. The motor has no housing/cover, so the carbon from the brushes coats the PCB and causes the VFD to fail if not cleaned.

Quick change post AXA?


Vanlig coolant-tray för D4000?

Varför är 2400 "ideal" för woodworking? Is it a bad idea to now and then turn wood on a D4000?

Is size A0 the correct size for D4000? I read somewhere that this size for Multifix was recommended for motor size < 1,1 kW.

How big is the bore in the boring bar holder? Are there sleeves included for using 12 mm or 10 mm bars?




Hi again.
I have some questions which I didn't get answers for.

1. Is this statement still true, or is the design improved?

From a forum post: "The larger motor is definitely German. I don't know where the standard motor comes from, but it has a poor design. The motor has no housing/cover, so the carbon from the brushes coats the PCB and causes the VFD to fail if not cleaned."

2. What is the specification for the stepper motors? I only got info on one of the motors. Are the motors protected by a housing with better IP protection than IP43? Ideally IP67, but at least IP53. With IP43 the steppers would clog over time with dust from wood turning and metal dust from grinding.

3. How should I mount boring bar in the boring bar holder? Do I have to make my own reduction sleeves? You sell both boring bars and boring bar holders, how do they match?
