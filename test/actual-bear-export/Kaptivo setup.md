Adjusting the whiteboard area that Kaptivo captures
If you remove and reinstall the Kaptivo, either on the same or different board, you may need to reset the boundaries of the whiteboard.
With power on, press and hold the button on the control pad until the indicator light flashes green and red. Reconnect your computer or mobile device to the KAPTIVO-xxxxxx Wi-Fi network. Then visit setup.kaptivo.liveÂ from your browser to reconfigure Kaptivo.
